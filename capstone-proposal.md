## <strong>Capstone Proposal</strong>

### Project Title:   
# <strong>Artist Profile</strong>

#### By:  David Jandron

### Project's Purpose or Goal:

This site will introduce viewers to my many works of art. There will also be an "About" portion that covers artist process, background, appearances, and uupcoming shows.

### Minimum Viable Product:

* _styled navigation bar_
* _images stored in database_
* _clickable images that take viewers to the details (informational text) of the images_
* _basic CSS/Bootstrap utilization_ 

### Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* _<strong>React</strong> (Will use youTube tutorial videos, React tracks from <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react">learnhowtoprogram.com</a>, previous React projects in my repository as reference points)_
* _<strong>Firebase</strong> cloud storage (Will use tracks from <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react">learnhowtoprogram.com</a> React week4, and youTube instructional videos)
* _<strong>Bootstrap</strong> styling library (Will use youTube instructional videos, and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap.com</a>)
* _<strong>JavaScript</strong> as it purtains to React tracks at link listed above.
* _<strong>Node.js</strong>
* _<strong>webpack</strong>_
* _<strong>Html</strong>
* _<strong>CSS</strong>

### Stretch Goals:

* Backend using a <strong>C# Api</strong> that contains image and details of the associated image.
* More complex <strong>Bootstrap</strong> stylings and animations
* A store for purchasing artwork, using a <strong>Paypal Api</strong>

### Additional tools, frameworks, libraries, and APIs, I will need for additional features?

* <strong>C# Api</strong> (Will use C# building an Api lessons (C# week 6) on <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net">learnhowtoprogram.com</a>)
* 

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
