## Capstone Proposal

### Project Title:   
## Artist Profile

#### By:  David Jandron

### Project's Purpose or Goal:

This site will introduce viewers to my many works of art. There will also be an "About" portion that covers artist process, background, appearances, and uupcoming shows.

### Minimum Viable Product:

* _styled navigation bar_
* _images stored in database_
* _clickable images that take viewers to the details (informational text) of the images_
* _basic CSS/Bootstrap utilization_ 

### Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* _Firebase cloud storage (Will use tracks from <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react">learnhowtoprogram.com</a> React week4, and youTube instructional videos)

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
